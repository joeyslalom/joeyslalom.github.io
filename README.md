# What

I work with the biggest iOS fanboys I know.  We talk about Apple every day.  They are also
iOS devs, and I am the biggest Google fanboy I know (am also a fan of Apple) so I
totally get it.  However, I've noticed their feelings towards Android range from apathy to
annoyance so I often get in conversations that are confusing to me.

I've begun to realize I simply use Android way more than they do, so things just make sense
to me in ways that don't occur to them.  So, I'm gathering these thoughts since I make
these points pretty often.

* API 21
* Android apps don't work like iOS apps
  * https://www.ckl.io/blog/designing-native-apps-for-android-and-ios-key-differences-and-similarities/
* BottomNavs didn't kill the Hamburger drawer
* OSS advantage
  * Developing on Android is much more than Java
  * Keep Open Source libraries updated as much as possible.  It's your only hope.
